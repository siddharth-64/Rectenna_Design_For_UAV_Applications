# 📡 Design of Compact Rectenna for UAV Applications

This repository contains the design, analysis, and simulation files for a **compact rectenna** system tailored for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** applications. The project focuses on a miniaturized and efficient energy harvesting system using radio frequency (RF) signals, optimized for size, gain, and circular polarization.
